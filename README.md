# Bank-Account-Final-Project-CSE-120

This is a simple bank account program that I created with a group of 4 for a Final Project in our CSE 110 class. It involves several modules that we had to learn outside of class including tkinter, PIL, and atexit. This program uses almost everything from our CSE 110 class with the exception of opening other files.
